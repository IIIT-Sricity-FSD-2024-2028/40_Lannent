Client:
  definition:
    The primary stakeholder or entity who initiates work by defining tasks
    and projects. They possess the authority to either post opportunities
    to a public marketplace or send direct engagement requests to specific
    gig workers.
  examples:
    - A small business owner posting a "Logo Design" project to a public board for open bidding.
  aliases:
    - Project Owner
    - Requester

Gig Worker:
  definition:
    An independent professional who evaluates project opportunities and
    retains the autonomy to accept or decline direct requests based on
    capacity and fit. They are responsible for delivering the scoped work
    upon mutual agreement.
  examples:
    - A freelance developer receives a direct request for a bug fix and chooses to accept it after reviewing the timeline.
  aliases:
    - creator
    - Freelance Talent

Expert Reviewer:
  definition:
    A subject matter expert responsible for evaluating deliverables against
    industry standards and Acceptance Criteria to ensure high-quality
    output before final client approval.
  examples:
    - A senior video editor hired to verify that a gig worker's raw footage meets the technical colour-grading requirements.
  aliases:
    - Quality Auditor
    - Subject Matter Expert (SME)

Discovery:
  definition: The process by which clients find gig workers (and vice versa) using niche filters, performance metrics, and portfolio alignment to determine a potential client-fit.
  examples:
    - A client manager using the platform to search for "Tech Reviewers" with an engagement rate over 5%.
  aliases:
    - Talent Sourcing
    - search

Scope:
  definition: The specific boundaries of a project, detailing exactly what is
    included (and excluded) regarding the number of assets, revisions,
    and the duration of the engagement to prevent unauthorised expansion
    of work.
  examples:
    - A contract stating "one 15-minute video and exactly two rounds of minor edits; additional edits billed at $50/hour."
  aliases:
    - Details
    - Requirements

Escrow:
  definition:
    A financial arrangement where a third-party (the platform) holds the
    project funds securely until the agreed-upon obligations are met,
    ensuring the gig worker is paid, and the client receives the work.
  examples:
    - A client deposits $500 into the platform's secure vault at the start of a project, released only after video approval.
  aliases:
    - Held Funds
    - Payment Protection

Milestone:
  definition: A significant stage or "checkpoint" within a project's timeline
    used to track progress, often tied to a percentage of the total
    payment or the release of specific deliverables.
  examples:
    - "Milestone 1: Script Approval (20% payment release); Milestone 2: Final Video Delivery (80% payment release)."
  aliases:
    - Project Phase
    - Payment Trigger

Escalation:
  definition:
    The formal process of raising a dispute or issue to a higher level of
    authority (such as platform support or legal mediation) when
    deadlines, quality standards, or communication protocols are breached.
  examples:
    - A gig worker filing a ticket when a client stops responding after receiving the final high-resolution assets.
  aliases:
    - Dispute
    - Conflict

Technical Audit:
  definition:
    A systematic and deep-dive evaluation of a deliverable's underlying
    structure such as code quality, security vulnerabilities, or
    performance benchmarks to ensure it meets requirements.
  examples:
    - Running a scan and manual code review on a new
      payment gateway module before it goes live.
  aliases:
    - Code Review
    - Compliance Check

Workroom:
  definition:
    A dedicated, secure digital space within the platform where the Client
    and Gig Workers collaborate on a specific project. It serves as the
    centralised hub for messaging, file sharing, progress tracking, and
    milestone management.
  examples:
    - An active dashboard where a developer uploads code snippets for a
      Client to review and provide real-time status updates.
  aliases:
    - Project Hub
    - Collaboration Suite
Funds:
  definition:
    The capital allocated by the Client for a specific project, usually 
    held in Escrow and released to the Gig Worker upon the successful 
    completion of milestones or final acceptance.
